# invisible-item-frames
Minecraft Datapack that makes your item frames look much better ;)

# Introducing 

The way that the datapack works is really simple.

# Usage

If you put an item named "invisible" (it could be any trash item it doesn't matter) to any item frame (glow or normal) it becomes invisible and if the placed item named "visible", the 
item frame will be visible. It is that easy.
